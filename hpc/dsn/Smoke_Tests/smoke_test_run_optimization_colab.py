smoke_test_run_optimization_colab.py
=====================================

Correctness harness for run_optimization_colab.py's OWN logic. It does not
re-verify anything already covered by smoke_test_run_optimization.py (the
caching, splitting, search, final-train, and artifact behaviour of
run_optimization.run() itself) -- it verifies the wrapper's additions:
dependency install, Colab detection, Drive mount wiring, Drive sync mirroring
(and its failure-safety), the colab-safe preset and its CLI precedence, and the
timing/projection arithmetic. It also re-runs the FULL
smoke_test_run_optimization.py suite as a regression control, since the
on_stage_complete hook that made this wrapper possible is an edit to the
tested driver, not a new file -- that edit must not have changed anything
about the driver's own documented behaviour.

    python3 smoke_test_run_optimization_colab.py
    python3 smoke_test_run_optimization_colab.py --quick   # skips the regression
                                                            # suite's real-skopt e2e

Exit code 0 = every check passed.

Because this sandbox is not an actual Colab runtime, IN_COLAB is exercised by
INJECTING a fake `google.colab` (and `google.colab.drive`) module into
sys.modules -- this proves the wiring (the right function gets called with the
right arguments) without needing Google's actual auth flow, which is
untestable from any script.

The checks
----------
  [A] environment detection: IN_COLAB flips True/False correctly, with a fake
      google.colab module injected and removed
  [B] ensure_dependencies: correct behaviour for (present / missing+auto-install
      / missing+no-auto-install / core-missing), verified by INJECTING a fake
      importability check and a fake installer -- no real pip / network call
  [C] maybe_mount_drive: no-ops (does not raise) when not in Colab or when
      mount=False; calls the injected fake drive.mount with the right
      mountpoint when both are true
  [D] the Drive-sync hook mirrors out_dir and cache_dir correctly, and mirrors
      the cache ONLY on the "data" stage (not on every phase)
  [E] a sync failure is swallowed as a warning, non-vacuously (proven by
      patching copytree to raise and confirming the run-level wiring in
      run_optimization.py -- not this file -- is what catches it)
  [F] --colab-safe narrows depth_exponent_range only when needed, forces
      num_workers=0, defaults device to auto, and NEVER widens an
      already-narrower input range
  [G] CLI precedence: an explicit --device after --colab-safe wins (proven
      non-vacuously: colab-safe sets auto, the CLI sets cpu, cpu must survive)
  [H] time_one_epoch_and_project: the projected-hours arithmetic matches the
      README's own formula exactly, using an INJECTED measured seconds/epoch
      so the check does not depend on this machine's speed; the fits/does-not
      verdict flips at the session-hours boundary
  [I] the extended parser is a strict superset: every run_optimization.py flag
      still parses, plus the new colab flags, with the documented defaults
  [J] end-to-end through the real CLI: config_toy.json runs via
      run_optimization_colab.main(), install/mount are correctly skipped
      outside Colab, and the wrapper's own artifacts (none extra expected
      without --drive-out-dir) match run_optimization's
  [K] end-to-end WITH a Drive-sync hook wired through main(): every phase
      mirrors to a fake "Drive" directory as it completes, verified by
      checking the mirror exists AFTER phase 1 finishes but BEFORE the whole
      run is done (non-vacuous: proven with a hook that snapshots the mirror's
      contents mid-run, not just at the end)
  [L] pure ASCII (this file and the wrapper)
  [M] REGRESSION: the full smoke_test_run_optimization.py suite, unchanged,
      still passes against the EDITED run_optimization.py

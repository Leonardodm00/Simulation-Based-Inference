smoke_test_train.py

Standalone correctness checks for train.py (Stage 5). CPU only, synthetic data
only, tiny net / short windows / few epochs. No data files, no cluster needed.

Run:
    python3 smoke_test_train.py

Runtime is a couple of minutes on CPU (real training loops, deliberately small).

Checks:
  [A] Builders: the loss AND the miner both carry CosineSimilarity (is_inverted =
      True). This is the silent-mismatch guard: PML's miner DEFAULTS to LpDistance,
      so if the cosine distance were passed only to the loss, triplets would be
      MINED under Euclidean geometry and SCORED under cosine.
  [B] derive_batches_per_epoch: 0 -> ceil(N_train / (C * B_c)); an explicit value
      >= 1 overrides. Boundary cases included.
  [C] It LEARNS: on separable synthetic phenotypes the best validation ARI beats
      the epoch-1 ARI and clears a floor. (The objective is validation ARI, never
      train loss -- decision 3.)
  [D] .item() is called EXACTLY ONCE per epoch (decision 13), asserted with a
      counter that patches torch.Tensor.item -- not by reading the source.
  [E] Early stopping FIRES before E_max on a plateau (tiny patience), and the
      returned history is shorter than E_max.
  [F] With P > E_max the ceiling fires instead, and the BEST-epoch (not the last)
      weights are returned: the restored model, re-embedded and re-scored, must
      REPRODUCE the ARI recorded at the best epoch of history.
  [G] ALL THREE mining strategies ("hard", "easy_positive",
      "easy_pos_semihard_neg") run and mine a non-empty
      total number of triplets.
  [H] Determinism: two runs with the same seed give identical history and
      bit-identical final weights.
  [I] Resume: an interrupted run (E1 epochs, then resumed to E1 + E2) matches an
      uninterrupted E1 + E2 run in history length and best epoch.
  [J] Multi-class C in {2, 3, 4}: K-means uses K = C and training runs end to end.
  [K] Anti-collapse diagnostics are LOGGED but never in the loss: every history
      record carries finite health fields.

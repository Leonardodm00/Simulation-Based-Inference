=========

Two-phase sequential Bayesian hyper-parameter optimization (skopt gp_minimize),
plus a CORRECTED space-narrowing helper (get_newspace).

Separation of concerns (directive 2): this module SEARCHES ONLY. It does not
train (train.train), does not score (metrics / evaluate), does not load data
(data_splits), does not persist checkpoints (checkpoint). It builds candidate
ExperimentConfigs, hands each to the SAME train() the final run uses, and reads
back the validation objective. That identity is the whole point: a configuration
is scored by exactly the procedure that will later fit the final model, so the
search cannot optimize a proxy that differs from deployment.

Why two SEQUENTIAL phases instead of one joint space
----------------------------------------------------
Phase 1 searches the ARCHITECTURE (4 HPs) with the optimizer HELD FIXED.
Phase 2 fixes the winning architecture and searches the TRAINING HPs (5 HPs).
A joint 9-D space would need far more calls for the same surrogate quality, and
the two groups interact only weakly. Sequential is the locked decision; the cost
is that phase 2's optimum is conditional on phase 1's architecture, which is why
do_retune_arch optionally re-runs phase 1 under the tuned optimizer.

Notation (symbols introduced at first use; carried in full)
-----------------------------------------------------------
Architecture space (phase 1), 4 hyper-parameters:
    d    : depth_exponent, Integer over cfg.search.depth_exponent_range
    wm   : width_multiplier, Real over cfg.search.width_multiplier_range
           (Real, NOT log-uniform: the range (1.5, 3.0) spans well under one
           decade, so a log prior would buy nothing and risks log(0) after
           narrowing)
    blk  : block_family, Categorical over cfg.search.block_family_choices,
           blk in {0, 1}. MUST be Categorical, never Real -- see BUG 2 below.
    es   : embedding_size, Integer over cfg.search.embedding_size_range

Training space (phase 2), 5 hyper-parameters:
    m      : margin, Real over cfg.search.margin_range
    lr     : learning rate, Real LOG-uniform over cfg.search.lr_range
    u1     : u1 = 1 - beta1, Real LOG-uniform over one_minus_beta1_range;
             the config gets beta1 = 1 - u1
    u2     : u2 = 1 - beta2, Real LOG-uniform over one_minus_beta2_range;
             the config gets beta2 = 1 - u2
    wd     : weight_decay, Real LOG-uniform over cfg.search.weight_decay_range

    The betas are searched as (1 - beta) in LOG space because beta1, beta2 live
    at 0.9 / 0.999, i.e. they crowd against 1. A uniform prior on beta itself
    would spend almost all its samples in a region where the effective averaging
    horizon 1/(1 - beta) barely changes, while the interesting variation (horizon
    10 vs 100 vs 1000 steps) is compressed into the last few percent. Searching
    u = 1 - beta in log space makes the sampling uniform in that horizon.

Objective (locked decision 3)
-----------------------------
For a sampled point x, build the ExperimentConfig, then for n = 0, ..., N_s - 1
(N_s = cfg.train.n_seeds) call

    train(cfg, splits.train, splits.val, device,
          seed = cfg.runtime.seed + t * N_s + n)

where t is the trial number (0-based). Each run returns its per-epoch history; we
take that run's BEST validation ARI,

    A_n = max over epochs e of ARI_e   (NaN epochs treated as -inf; see below)

and return the NEGATIVE mean over seeds,

    f(x) = - (1 / N_s) * sum_{n=0..N_s-1} A_n

because gp_minimize MINIMIZES. The per-seed standard deviation

    s(x) = sqrt( (1 / N_s) * sum_n (A_n - mean_n A_n)^2 )     (population std)

is LOGGED, not optimized: it is the honest GP noise level, and reporting it is
what lets you see whether a "better" trial is actually better or just luckier.

The seed formula guarantees DISJOINT seed sets across trials (trial t uses seeds
[s0 + t*N_s, s0 + t*N_s + N_s), which never overlap for different t), so no two
trials are accidentally scored on the same random draws -- while remaining fully
reproducible for a fixed cfg.runtime.seed.

Degenerate trials
-----------------
A trial can fail to produce a finite ARI (e.g. a config that collapses, or a
train() that raises). Such a trial returns _FAILED_OBJECTIVE = +1.0, i.e. the
worst possible value of -ARI given ARI in [-0.5, 1] (so -ARI in [-1, 0.5]); +1.0
is strictly worse than any achievable score, so the GP learns to avoid that region
WITHOUT the search crashing. NaN is never returned: gp_minimize's surrogate cannot
fit NaN and would abort the whole study.

The four legacy get_newspace bugs this module fixes (read from the legacy source,
1D_CNN_functions.get_newspace, approx. lines 2592-2672 -- not from memory)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  BUG 1 -- THE INDEX BUG. The legacy line reads
               es = Real(lower_bounds[3], upper_bounds[3], name='Embedding size')
           but [3] is the WIDTH-SHRINK column; embedding size is column [4]. So the
           refined embedding-size range was silently the width-shrink range, and es
           became perfectly correlated with ws. (This module's space has no ws at
           all -- the arch space is the 4 HPs above -- so the corrected code indexes
           each dimension BY NAME rather than by a hard-coded integer, which makes
           the class of bug unrepresentable.)

  BUG 2 -- EVERYTHING WAS Real. The legacy code built blk and es (both DISCRETE)
           as Real dimensions. A Real blk yields floats such as 0.37, and
           Block_array[0.37] raises TypeError. Here blk is Categorical and d / es
           are Integer, so the sampled values are directly usable as an index and
           as a size.

  BUG 3 -- log-uniform ON A POSSIBLY-ZERO LOWER BOUND. The legacy d and wm were
           Real(..., 'log-uniform'). skopt raises ValueError("search space should
           not contain 0 when using log-uniform prior") whenever narrowing pushes a
           lower bound to 0. Verified against skopt 0.10.2. No dimension in the
           refined ARCH space uses a log prior here.

  BUG 4 -- NO DEGENERATE-RANGE GUARD. If every top-scoring point shares one value
           for a hyper-parameter (which is exactly what happens when the search
           CONVERGES), then lower == upper and skopt raises ValueError("the lower
           bound X has to be less than the upper bound X"). Verified for both
           Integer(3,3) and Real(1.5,1.5). _guard_* below widens an Integer by +/-1
           WITHIN the original bounds, and pins a truly unwidenable dimension as a
           single-value Categorical (which skopt accepts).

backend forced by evaluate.py's import; search.py never calls plt.show().

    superset=False (DEFAULT, and every pre-existing caller) returns the names

    static superset". Making that unconditional would silently widen the STAGED

    * Columns are addressed BY NAME (via _ARCH_NAMES), never by a hard-coded index,
      so BUG 1 (es reading the ws column) cannot recur.
    * Each HP keeps its ORIGINAL TYPE: Integer stays Integer, Categorical stays
      Categorical (narrowed to the subset of families actually seen among the best
      points), Real stays Real. BUG 2 cannot recur.
    * No log prior is applied. BUG 3 cannot recur.
    * Every dimension goes through a _guard_*, so a converged (lower == upper)
      dimension is widened or pinned rather than raising. BUG 4 cannot recur.

        <= 0) reproduces the legacy hard-coded rule min(10, max(1, n_calls // 2))
        EXACTLY, so pre-C3 configs are unaffected.
    [C2] epsilon : tie-break weight, or None for the pre-C2 primary-only objective.
    annotate : optional point -> dict, merged into the trial record BEFORE the
        trial runs. This is how the legality projection Pi becomes visible: a
        projected trial is recorded as projected rather than silently building
        a different config than its coordinates suggest. It must be pure and
        cheap; if it raises, the trial still runs and the error is recorded
        instead, because a logging fault must never cost a training run.
    persist : optional search_persistence.TrialWriter. When given, every
        completed trial record is appended to trials.jsonl and FLUSHED before
        the next trial starts, and search_state.json is rewritten with the
        running best. A study killed at the walltime then leaves k usable
        records instead of nothing. A fault in the writer is warned about and
        swallowed, for the same reason annotate's is: logging must never cost a
        training run that has already been paid for.
    axis_names : the names of the coordinates of space, in order. Required
        whenever persist is given, because the RAW sampled point is recorded BY
        NAME rather than positionally -- a later reordering of the space would
        otherwise silently reinterpret every stored coordinate. See
        search_persistence for why the raw point and not the projected one.
    warm_start : optional search_persistence.WarmStart from earlier segments.
        Supplying it makes this call a CONTINUATION rather than a fresh study:
        the k completed observations are handed to gp_minimize as x0/y0, the
        trial counter starts at k so the disjoint seed blocks continue instead
        of being reused, and the budget is recomputed by resolve_resume_budget.

    THE TRIAL COUNTER IS THE SEED. evaluate_candidate derives
    seed = base_seed + t * n_seeds + n from the counter, so trials own disjoint
    seed blocks. A resumed segment that restarted the counter at 0 would hand
    trials k, k+1, ... the seed blocks of trials 0, 1, ..., which is not a
    crash and not visible in any output -- it just quietly re-runs the same
    initialisations under different coordinates. Hence trial_offset.

    because skopt one-hots every Categorical:

        12 numeric  (1, 2, 4-12, 18 minus block_family)  -> 12 columns
         4 binaries as Integer(0, 1)                     ->  4 columns
         2 three-level Categorical (13, 14)              ->  6 columns
                                                            ---------
                                                             22 columns

    Encoding the five binaries as Integer rather than Categorical is what saves
    5 columns: a two-level one-hot is exactly redundant (x2 = 1 - x1). This
    includes block_family, which departs from the letter of the BUG 2 note
    above but not its substance -- that warning is specifically that a REAL
    block_family yields floats such as 0.37, so Block_array[0.37] raises
    TypeError. Integer yields genuine Python ints. The smoke test ASSERTS the
    int-ness rather than trusting this paragraph.

    Up to 3 of the 22 columns are INACTIVE for any given trial (the loss HPs
    outside A(l)). _write_loss_hps clamps them so they never reach the config,
    which turns them into genuinely flat directions for the surrogate rather
    than noise-injecting ones; ARD length-scales absorb flat directions. What
    that costs in sample efficiency at this budget is not estimated anywhere.

    Cells, Pi and the coverage arithmetic are UNAFFECTED by the tau axis: tau
    is not part of the cell definition, so the space is still 52 cells.

    trial whose coordinates said (hard, joint_sep, strict=True) but which
    trained (hard, joint_sep, strict=False) must be readable as such, or the
    duplicated observations the GP receives look like noise.

    train_cfg is OPTIONAL and defaults to None, so every pre-existing
    one-argument caller keeps working. When it is supplied AND the sampled loss
    type is "joint_sep", two further quantities are recorded, and they are the
    whole reason tau became a searched axis rather than a fixed knob:

        sep_dose            lambda_sep * T * (1 - tau/2), the INTEGRAL of the

        sep_terminal_weight lambda_sep * g(T), the weight in force at the last
                            planned step.

    Equal-dose settings can differ in terminal weight, which is exactly why the
    dose is not a sufficient statistic for tau. Without BOTH in the log, the
    post-hoc question "did tau matter through the integral or through the
    shape?" cannot be answered at all.

    T IS NOT ALWAYS KNOWABLE HERE. batches_per_epoch = 0 means "derive n_b at
    trainer build time as ceil(N_train / (C * B_c))", so T = E_max * n_b does
    not exist yet. In that case sep_planned_steps and sep_dose are None and the
    T-FREE ratio sep_dose_per_step = lambda_sep * (1 - tau/2) = sep_dose / T is
    recorded instead, which is enough to rank trials against each other at a
    common T. Reporting None beats reporting a number computed from a guessed
    n_b.

    OFF BY ONE, STATED SO IT IS NOT REDISCOVERED. sep_terminal_weight is
    lambda_sep * g(T) as the design document defines it, but the last batch of
    a run passes t = T - 1, not t = T, because t counts steps COMPLETED. The
    difference is one step of the ramp and is immaterial at T >> 1; it is the
    same lag SepWarmup's own docstring records for the per-epoch history.

      3. The recorded epsilon differs from the one resolved for this segment.
         Also inside build_warm_start: J_eps = -(ARI + epsilon * sbar), so a
         different epsilon is a different objective and the recorded Y0 is not
         commensurable with the trials about to be run.

    resume_search with no log present is NOT an error: it is the first segment

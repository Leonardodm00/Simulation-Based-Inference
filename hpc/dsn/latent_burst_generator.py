latent_burst_generator.py
=========================

An n-latent-factor phenotype generator built ON TOP of the existing
network-burst model in generate_burst_data.py.

Why this module exists
----------------------
The current MultiClassSyntheticProvider (data_splits.py) drives BOTH of its
degrees of freedom (burst rate, burst width) from a SINGLE scalar
    frac = condition / (C - 1),
so the true data manifold is one-dimensional and the C classes are three points
on a line. Two consequences, both fatal for model selection:

  (i)  the task is solvable by one hand-crafted scalar, so validation ARI
       saturates at 1.0 and the Bayesian-optimization objective is constant;
  (ii) eff_rank ~= 1 is simultaneously the CORRECT answer (the data really is
       1-D) and the signature of representation collapse, so the collapse
       tripwire cannot fire and the hard-vs-easy-positive miner question is
       formally undecidable on this benchmark.

This module fixes both by making the latent dimensionality, the class overlap,
and the label-relevance of each factor explicit and tunable.

Separation of concerns (directive 2)
------------------------------------
  section 1 : latent-space definition and axis maps  (no sampling, no signals)
  section 2 : per-trace latent sampling              (no signal synthesis)
  section 3 : latent -> BurstParams                  (pure parameter mapping)
  section 4 : provider (signal synthesis)            (delegates to generate_burst_data)
  section 5 : ground-truth export for factor-retention analysis
This module never trains, never scores, never plots. It reuses
generate_burst_data.generate_spike_times and .compute_ifr_trace unchanged
(directive 1: do not reimplement what is already tested).

Notation (symbols introduced at first use; carried in full)
-----------------------------------------------------------
    n            : number of latent factors, n in N, n >= 1
    k            : latent axis index, k in {1, ..., n}
    phi          : latent coordinate vector, phi = (phi_1, ..., phi_n),
                   phi in [0, 1]^n. Normalized: 0 = low end of the axis range,
                   1 = high end. Dimensionless by construction.
    C            : number of phenotype classes, class label c in {0, ..., C-1}
    S            : label-carrying axis subset, S subset= {1, ..., n}, S nonempty.
                   Axes k in S determine the class; axes k not in S are
                   label-IRRELEVANT but physically real variation.
    m_c          : class mean position along every label axis,
                   m_c = c / (C - 1) in [0, 1] for C >= 2 (m_0 = 0 if C == 1)
    tau          : class overlap (spread of traces about their class mean),
                   tau >= 0, dimensionless in normalized latent units.
                   tau = 0 reproduces the current deterministic behaviour;
                   tau > 0 makes classes overlap and the task non-trivial.
    r            : trace index within a class, r in {0, ..., n_c - 1}
    theta        : the BurstParams instance produced by a latent vector phi
    x            : the synthesized IFR trace, x in R_{>=0}^{K}
    f_s          : IFR sampling rate [Hz], f_s = 1 / Delta_t

    Per-axis affine map. For axis k with range [a_k, b_k] and orientation
    s_k in {+1, -1}:
        value_k(phi_k) = a_k + (b_k - a_k) * u_k,
        u_k = phi_k        if s_k = +1,
        u_k = 1 - phi_k    if s_k = -1,
    for each fixed k in {1, ..., n} and every phi_k in [0, 1].

Biological grounding (see the accompanying document for full citations)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The CHOICE of axes and the DIRECTION of their effects follow the feature set
and the random-forest feature importances reported for developing rat cortical
cultures on multiwell MEAs (Cotterill et al., J Biomol Screen 2016; full text
read). In particular that study reports that the two most discriminative
features of network age were the coefficient of variation of the within-burst
inter-spike interval and the CV of the inter-burst interval, and that mean
burst duration did NOT show strong developmentally related changes. That is
why AX_IRREGULARITY is the default label axis and AX_BURST_DURATION is a
default label-IRRELEVANT axis.

The numeric RANGES below are NOT independently sourced. They are chosen to
bracket the CONTROL_PARAMS / PATHO_PARAMS values already present in
generate_burst_data.py, so that the existing two-condition setting is a point
inside the new latent space. They are exposed as configuration precisely
because they should be re-fitted to the user's own recordings before any
biological claim is made.

HPC note (hpc-python-compat): pure ASCII. The single local module imported
here, generate_burst_data.py, was byte-verified pure ASCII as well (Rule 6).

          middle class, which is untouched. Raising tau does not fix this: the
          pinned FRACTION is invariant in tau (it is just P(eps < 0) = 1/2),
          so a larger tau only grows a spike of probability mass sitting
          exactly at 0 and at 1.

      "interior" (the DEFAULT):    m_c = (c + 1) / (C + 1), m_c in (0, 1)
          Every centre is strictly interior, at C = 3 giving 0.25, 0.50, 0.75.
          No centre touches a boundary, so clipping becomes rare rather than
          systematic and the realised within-class spread equals tau for every
          class alike. tau becomes a knob that means what it says.

    The trade: interior spacing HALVES the adjacent-centre gap (0.50 -> 0.25 at
    C = 3), so at fixed tau the task is substantially harder. MEASURED at
    C = 3, tau = 0.10, 180 windows: a mean-IFR-only baseline scores ARI 0.3821
    under "endpoints" but 0.1877 under "interior" -- i.e. interior spacing also
    closes about half of the single-scalar shortcut, which is the reason to
    prefer it beyond the clipping argument. Choose tau AFTER choosing the mode;
    the two are not independent.

    For C == 1 there is no meaningful spacing: "interior" returns 0.5 (the
    centre of the range) and "endpoints" returns 0.0 (its historical value).

    """(C, L) matrix of class centres in [0, 1]^L, one row per class.

    THE DEFECT THIS FIXES. "interior" and "endpoints" return a single SCALAR
    m_c and the caller writes it to EVERY label axis, so class c sits at
    m_c * (1, 1, ..., 1): all C centres lie on the main diagonal of the label
    subspace. Cov({mu_c}) then has rank 1 whatever L and C are -- the centres
    are collinear, and any objective that asks for a non-degenerate ARRANGEMENT
    of centres (the NC2 separation term) is asking for a geometry the DATA does
    not contain.

    "simplex" (the default) places the C centres at the vertices of a regular
    simplex instead. Construction:

      1. P = I_C - 11^T / C is the centring projector; its SVD gives C rows
         with pairwise cosine exactly -1/(C-1) spanning C-1 dimensions -- the
         canonical regular simplex, and exactly the configuration L_sep
         targets.
      2. Those coordinates are embedded in the L label axes. If L >= C-1 an
         orthonormal DCT-II rotation spreads them over ALL L axes, so no label
         axis is left carrying zero class information. If L < C-1 the first L
         coordinates are used and the rank is L, which is the most any L axes
         can carry.
      3. The result is scaled about 0.5 to fill the same interior box the
         "interior" mode uses, so no centre touches the clip boundary.

    Achieved rank is min(L, C-1), the maximum possible: C points span at most
    C-1 dimensions however many axes they are written to.

    NOTE the spacing changes. "interior" puts adjacent centres (C+1)^-1 apart
    along one line; the simplex spreads the same box over min(L, C-1)
    directions, so the realised centre-to-centre distance differs and
    class_overlap (tau) should be re-checked rather than carried over.

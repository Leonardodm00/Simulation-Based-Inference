evaluate.py
===========

Evaluation + the embedding figure. Separation of concerns (directive 2): this
module SCORES and PLOTS ONLY. It never trains, never optimizes, never loads raw
data, never builds a model. It calls the already-tested modules:

    inference.embed_clean_windows  -- the DISTINCT-window embedding (shared with
                                      the trainer, so eval and validation embed
                                      identically; it is not re-implemented here)
    metrics.clustering_metrics     -- the single seeded full-D K-means + ARI / AMI
                                      / silhouette
    metrics.embedding_health       -- the monitor-only collapse diagnostics

Headless by construction: matplotlib's Agg backend is selected BEFORE pyplot is
imported, so this module is importable and usable on a compute node with no
display. There is no plt.show() anywhere, and there is no Visible flag.

The four legacy bugs this module removes (read from the legacy source, not from
memory -- 1D_CNN_functions.Embedding_Scores, approx. lines 3156-3239)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  (1) METRIC / PLOT MISMATCH. The legacy metric fitted a SEEDED K-means
      (random_state=0) on the FULL-DIMENSIONAL embeddings, but the figure then
      fitted a SECOND, UNSEEDED K-means (n_init=4, no random_state) on the
      PCA(2)-REDUCED data. The clusters that were SCORED and the clusters that
      were DRAWN were therefore two different fits, in two different spaces, and
      could disagree arbitrarily. Here there is EXACTLY ONE clustering: the
      labels_pred returned by metrics.clustering_metrics are the SAME array that
      colours the scatter. PCA is used for DISPLAY ONLY -- it never re-clusters.

  (2) Visible=False -> NameError. The legacy function assigned reduced_data only
      inside `if Visible == True:` but returned it unconditionally, so every
      headless call crashed. The Visible flag is REMOVED entirely; the figure is
      always written with savefig, never shown.

  (3) The legacy figure's scatter of the actual points was COMMENTED OUT: it drew
      undifferentiated black dots ("k.") over a decision-boundary mesh, carrying
      NO label information at all. Here every point is drawn and doubly encoded
      (see plot_embedding).

  (4) The decision-boundary MESH is DROPPED. It was computed from the PCA-space
      K-means, i.e. from the wrong fit; and a Voronoi mesh of a 2-D projection
      says nothing about the decision structure of the full-dimensional embedding
      it is meant to illustrate.

    N            : number of DISTINCT windows in the evaluated dataset,
                   N = len(dataset.index)
    E            : embedding dimension, E = cfg.backbone.embedding_size
    C            : number of phenotype classes, labels in {0, ..., C-1}
    Z            : (N, E) float32 embedding matrix, rows z_i = f_theta(x_i) for the
                   i-th CLEAN window x_i; each row is L2-normalized by the backbone
                   head (||z_i||_2 = 1 when cfg.backbone.l2_normalize, the default),
                   so the z_i live on the unit hypersphere S^{E-1}
    y            : (N,) int64 TRUE phenotype labels, y_i in {0, ..., C-1}
    K            : number of K-means clusters. K = C ALWAYS (locked invariant), and
                   C is taken from the FULL label set supplied by the caller, NOT
                   from the labels that happen to appear in the evaluated split
                   (see n_clusters below)
    labels_pred  : (N,) int64 K-means assignments, labels_pred_i in {0, ..., K-1},
                   from the ONE seeded K-means fitted on the FULL-dimensional Z.
                   These are the labels that BOTH define the reported ARI / AMI AND
                   colour the figure.
    P            : PCA display dimension, P = eval_cfg.pca_components (default 2).
                   The PCA map is a linear projection R^E -> R^P used for DRAWING
                   ONLY; no metric is ever computed in the projected space.
    Z_pca        : (N, P) float64, Z_pca = PCA(P).fit_transform(Z)

Scoring
-------
    ari         = adjusted_rand_score(y, labels_pred)             in [-0.5, 1]
    ami         = adjusted_mutual_info_score(y, labels_pred)      in [~0, 1]
    silhouette  = mean silhouette of Z against the TRUE labels y under the cosine
                  distance d_cos(u, v) = 1 - (u . v) / (||u||_2 ||v||_2). It is
                  computed against y (not against labels_pred), so it is a
                  K-means-INDEPENDENT companion to ARI / AMI, and cosine matches
                  the unit-sphere geometry the network was trained in.
    All three come from metrics.clustering_metrics; this module adds no scoring
    mathematics of its own (directive 1: reuse the tested implementation).

HPC note (hpc-python-compat): pure ASCII. The Agg backend is forced before
pyplot is imported, so importing this module cannot try to open a display.

                 whose windows are DISJOINT from train and val by construction
                 (time-segment splitting), so there is no leakage.
    device     : torch device or "cpu" / "cuda" / "auto"
    seed       : random_state of the ONE K-means fit (reproducible)
    n_clusters : K. Pass C from the FULL label set (see _resolve_n_clusters).
                 None -> inferred from the labels present in `dataset`.
    eval_cfg   : EvalConfig (kmeans_seed / kmeans_n_init / silhouette_metric /
                 pca_components). When given, its kmeans_n_init and
                 silhouette_metric are used; `seed` still wins over kmeans_seed so

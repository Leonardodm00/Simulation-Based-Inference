make_joint_search_config.py
===========================

Emit THE ONE config that replaces the 52-cell factorial.

        --base hpc/Config/config_l3c_h_multimean_005.json \\
        --out  hpc/Config/config_l3c_joint_search.json

WHY A GENERATOR AND NOT A CHECKED-IN JSON
-----------------------------------------
Two of the numbers this file writes are NOT settled, and a checked-in JSON
would freeze them silently:

  * max_epochs / patience. The design document computes that N_calls = 300 at
    E_max = 100 and n_batches = 100 needs roughly 157 h against a 144 h
    walltime, and RECOMMENDS E_max = 60, P = 20 -- explicitly recorded as "not
    yet accepted by the user". The defaults here are therefore the STATED
    values (100 / 40), and --max-epochs / --patience change them. Either way
    this script prints the walltime arithmetic, so the choice is made with the
    number in front of you rather than by whichever value happened to be
    committed.

  * the architecture size-mix multiplier, which is UNMEASURED. The estimate
    below is the depth-4 rate; a search that samples depth-5 backbones (about
    20 M parameters against 2.6 M at depth 4) will exceed it by an unknown
    factor. Stage 7 (--search-dry-run, then timing 10 sampled points end to
    end) is what resolves this. DO NOT SUBMIT on the strength of the number
    printed here.

WHAT IS SET, AND WHY
--------------------
  search.search_mode = "joint_conditions"   the 18-axis space
  the six *_choices lists                   the full factorial, as levels
  search ranges                             the design document's table
  train.n_seeds = 1                         deliberate: see the note printed
  train.batches_per_epoch = 100             6.7x the screening's step budget,
                                            and the single most important
                                            change in the design
  search.sep_warmup_frac_range              tau, SEARCHED (18th axis). The
                                            UPPER bound written here is a
                                            REQUEST: search._loss_dims clips it
                                            to the DERIVED cap
                                            min(1, patience/max_epochs) so the
                                            ramp always completes before the
                                            earliest possible early stop. The
                                            cap is printed below.
  train.sep_warmup_frac = 0.0               NOT a value that will be used --
                                            it is the CLAMP CONSTANT for the
                                            trials where tau is inactive
                                            (every non-joint_sep trial), and
                                            must be the TrainConfig default.
  train.lambda_sep = 0.1                    NOT a value that will be used --
                                            it is the CLAMP CONSTANT for the
                                            trials where lambda_sep is
                                            inactive. It must be exactly the
                                            TrainConfig default, or every
                                            triplet/joint trial fires the
                                            "INERT lambda_sep" RuntimeWarning
                                            and the reader learns to ignore
                                            warnings.
  train.sep_gate_* left as they are         inert; the gate is gone
  search.tie_break_gamma = 0.0              inert under a continuous primary
                                            anyway; 0 is the quiet way to say
                                            so (smoke_test [6-H])

WHAT IS NOT SET
---------------
make_factorial_configs.py is NOT superseded: it stays for the SCREENING tier,
which is how the 52 cells were produced and is still the cheap way to ask which
regions are worth searching at all.

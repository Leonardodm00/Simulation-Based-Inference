# Launch the 3x2 factorial:

# Run from Main/ on a LOGIN node (it only submits; it does not train).
#
# Step 1 exists to avoid a RACE: all six jobs read the SAME benchmark and would
# otherwise each try to synthesize and write the trace cache at the same time.
# cache_traces() skips traces already on disk, so populating the cache ONCE up
# front makes all six jobs read-only against it. manifest.json is written
# atomically, but six concurrent writers is a risk not worth taking for the
# ~10 s this costs.

# run_all_smoke_tests.sh
# =======================
# Correct invocation of Smoke_Tests/run_all_smoke_tests.py.
#
# WHY THIS WRAPPER EXISTS
# ------------------------
# The documented command
#
#     cd Main && PYTHONPATH=. python3 Smoke_Tests/run_all_smoke_tests.py
#
# is WRONG for this specific runner, and it fails silently-ish (as
# ModuleNotFoundError inside individual suites, not as an obvious top-level
# error). run_all_smoke_tests.py spawns each suite as a SEPARATE subprocess
# with its own cwd set to Smoke_Tests/ (see subprocess.run(cmd, cwd=str(here))
# in the runner). A RELATIVE PYTHONPATH="." is resolved by each subprocess
# against ITS OWN cwd -- which is Smoke_Tests/, not Main/ -- so any suite that
# does not independently self-locate Main/ via __file__ raises
# "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'config'" (or 'backbone', etc.), while
# suites that do self-locate happen to pass regardless. This produces a
# confusing PARTIAL pass/fail pattern that looks like a real code problem but
# is purely an invocation issue.
#
# The fix is a one-word change: PYTHONPATH must be an ABSOLUTE path to Main/,
# which resolves identically no matter what cwd a spawned subprocess ends up
# in. That is all this script does.
#
# Usage (from anywhere):
#     bash run_all_smoke_tests.sh                 # run all 25 suites
#     bash run_all_smoke_tests.sh --quick          # pass --quick where accepted
#     bash run_all_smoke_tests.sh --only train      # substring-match suites
#
# Requires: python3 with torch, pytorch_metric_learning, scikit-optimize,
# scikit-learn, numpy, scipy installed (the cluster environment; this is NOT
# the pure-shell landing script from earlier -- Python is required here
# because the suites themselves are Python).

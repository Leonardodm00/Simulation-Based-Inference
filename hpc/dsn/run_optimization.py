run_optimization.py
===================

THE DRIVER for the contrastive MEA phenotype pipeline (Topic 1 augmentation,
Topic 2 backbone, Topic 3 optimization). One script that loads the data, trains
/ optimizes the architecture, and saves the trained architecture.

Pure orchestration (directive 2): this file contains NO science. It decides the
ORDER of the stages, runs the pre-flight checks, and wires artifacts to disk.
Every scientific decision lives in the already-tested modules it calls:

    preprocessing_cache.cache_traces / load_cached_traces  persist traces ONCE
    data_splits.make_time_segment_splits                   leakage-free splits
    search.search_architecture / search_training /
           retune_architecture / search_regularization      the HPO phases
    train.train                                            the ONE trainer
    evaluate.evaluate_and_plot                             held-out TEST scoring
    checkpoint.save_checkpoint                             self-describing .pt

Pipeline
--------
    resolve config -> resolve device -> seed -> PRE-FLIGHTS -> cache traces
      -> time-segment splits
      -> [PHASE 1: architecture] -> [PHASE 2: training HPs] -> [re-tune]
      -> [REGULARIZATION: dropout + weight decay]
      -> FINAL: train N_s models -> held-out TEST evaluation -> artifacts

Every bracketed stage is skipped by --skip-search, which reduces the driver to
"load the data, train the configured architecture, evaluate it, save it".

Notation (carried in full; symbols introduced at first use)
-----------------------------------------------------------
    C     : number of phenotype classes; labels in {0, ..., C-1}
    N_s   : cfg.train.n_seeds, models trained per configuration
    B_c   : cfg.train.windows_per_condition, source windows drawn from EACH
            class per batch
    P, N  : cfg.data.augmentation.n_positives / n_negatives, the profile-
            PRESERVING and profile-DESTROYING surrogates built per source window
    M     : rows in one embedding batch,  M = C * B_c * (1 + P + N)
    W     : window length in samples, W = round(cfg.data.window_s * fs)
    f_s   : sampling rate [Hz], resolved from the DATA (never from the config's
            AugmentationConfig.fs, which is a placeholder)
    E     : embedding dimension, cfg.backbone.embedding_size
    ARI_e : adjusted Rand index on the VALIDATION split at epoch e

Artifacts
---------

      config_input.json       the config as resolved (file + CLI), before search
      config_best.json        the config after every search phase

      checkpoints/
        seed_<n>/{last,best}.pt      resumable, written DURING the final train
        final_seed_<n>.pt            self-describing, best-epoch weights
        best_model.pt                [ADDED] the deployable model (see below)

Additions beyond the behaviour described in 02_TECHNICAL.md / 03_USAGE.md
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each is marked [ADDED] at its definition. They are additions, not changes: no
tested module is modified.

  [ADDED 1] DROPOUT IS PINNED TO 0 FOR THE WHOLE SEARCH. Decision 11 says
      dropout is tuned ONLY in the regularization stage. search.py enforces that
      in config_from_arch_point (which pins dropout=0.0) but NOT in
      config_from_train_point, which inherits dropout from the base config. So a
      user config with backbone.dropout > 0 would silently run phase 1 at
      dropout 0 and phase 2 at dropout > 0 -- two phases under different
      regularization. The driver pins it to 0 across phases 1, 2 and the re-tune,
      and lets the regularization stage set the final value.

  [ADDED 2] best_model.pt, SELECTED ON VALIDATION, NEVER ON TEST. Of the N_s
      final models, the one with the highest best-epoch VALIDATION ARI is copied
      to best_model.pt. Selecting on the test ARI would leak the held-out split
      into model selection and destroy the honesty of the reported test number.

  [ADDED 3] A DATA FINGERPRINT GUARDS THE TRACE CACHE. cache_traces skips any
      trace whose <name>.npz already exists. That is what makes an HPO run pay
      the trace cost once -- but it also means that changing the data source
      (e.g. synthetic_duration_s, or switching to numpy mode) while pointing at
      the SAME cache_dir would silently reuse the STALE traces. The driver writes
      a fingerprint of the data-source config into the cache and refuses to
      proceed on a mismatch, naming the fix (--overwrite-cache or a new
      --cache-dir).

  [ADDED 4] MODEL SIZES ARE COUNTED ON THE META DEVICE. The size pre-flight must
      not allocate the memory it exists to warn about. Building each corner under
      torch.device("meta") allocates zero bytes; verified to give parameter
      counts identical to a real construction.

  [ADDED 5] BOTH BLOCK FAMILIES ARE REPORTED AT EACH CORNER. The ResNet family
      (block_family=0) is ~3x heavier than ResNeXt (block_family=1) at the same
      (depth, width), and the search samples BOTH. Reporting only one family
      understates the worst corner the search will actually visit.

  [ADDED 6] FINAL SEEDS COME FROM A DISJOINT BLOCK. A search trial t uses seeds
      [s0 + t*N_s, s0 + t*N_s + N_s). The final models use
      s0 + FINAL_SEED_OFFSET + n, which cannot collide with any trial's block, so
      the final fit is not scored on the very draws that selected the config.

  [ADDED 7] STALE-RESUME GUARD. train() RESUMES automatically whenever a
      last.pt exists in the checkpoint directory it is given. Re-running with a
      different architecture and the same out_dir would therefore try to load old
      weights into a new model. Unless --resume is passed, the driver clears the
      seed's checkpoint directory first.

  [ADDED 8] data_mode="real" IS WIRED. 02_TECHNICAL.md sec. 15 lists it as a known
      gap ("Not wired into build_traces"). It is now wired through
      data_pipeline.NeuronalTracesProvider; the engine module that exports
      Neuronal_traces is named with --engine-module. Without that flag the branch
      raises a NotImplementedError that names the fix, exactly as before.

  [ADDED 9] EVALUABILITY PRE-FLIGHT. A split can be non-empty yet unscorable: a
      K-means with K = C needs at least C windows, and a silhouette needs at
      least 2 windows in each class. The driver warns per split, per class.

  [ADDED 10] --skip-regularization, and --dry-run reports the budget for the
      stages that will ACTUALLY run.

HPC note (hpc-python-compat): this file is pure ASCII, and every local module in
its import chain (config, backbone, augmentation, data_pipeline,
preprocessing_cache, data_splits, metrics, checkpoint, inference, train,
evaluate, search) is pure ASCII as well. Matplotlib's Agg backend is forced by
evaluate.py, which is imported here before any figure is produced, so the driver
cannot try to open a display.

    Windows are formed INSIDE a time segment (that is the leakage guarantee), so
    a window longer than the shortest segment yields ZERO windows for that split
    and the run dies. The shipped defaults are infeasible: window_s = 200 s
    against a 600 s recording split 60/20/20 leaves 120 s val and test segments.

    The rule, per split k with fraction f_k and trace of length L_c samples:

        W = round(window_s * fs)  <=  floor(f_k * L_c)      for every trace c

    Reuses data_splits.segment_bounds and data_splits.window_starts, which are
    the SAME functions the real split uses -- so this check cannot drift away

    Two call forms, both supported:

            The form 02_TECHNICAL.md documents and smoke_test_end_to_end.py

            be the same length, which is true for synthetic data.

        check_window_feasibility(cfg, trace_lengths, conditions, fs)
            The form the driver itself uses: a LIST of per-trace lengths and
            their phenotype labels. Real .npz recordings are NOT all the same
            length, and the scalar form can only ever check one of them; this
            form checks every trace, and additionally reports per-class window
            counts so the evaluability warning below can fire.

    Returns a FeasibilityReport: a dict of {"train","val","test"} -> window

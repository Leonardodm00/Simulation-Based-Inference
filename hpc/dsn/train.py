train.py
========

The core trainer. ONE function, train(), used IDENTICALLY by the Stage-7 HPO
objective and by the Stage-8 final run -- that identity is the whole point: a
hyper-parameter configuration is scored by exactly the procedure that will later
be used to fit the final model, so the search cannot optimize a proxy that
differs from deployment.

Separation of concerns (directive 2): this module OPTIMIZES ONLY. It does not
load data (data_pipeline / data_splits), does not score (metrics), does not embed
(inference), does not persist (checkpoint), does not plot (Stage 6). It calls
those tested modules and owns nothing but the optimization loop.

Scope: train() runs a SINGLE seed. The N_seeds averaging demanded by the
objective (decision 3) is done by the Stage-7 caller, which invokes train()
n_seeds times and averages the returned best validation metrics. Keeping the
seed loop OUT of here is what lets the search report an honest seed-to-seed std.

Notation (carried in full; symbols introduced at first use)
-----------------------------------------------------------
Data / batching
    C          : number of distinct phenotype classes, labels in {0, ..., C-1}
    B_c        : cfg.train.windows_per_condition, source windows drawn from EACH
                 class per batch
    n_batches  : cfg.train.batches_per_epoch, batches per epoch. When it is 0 it
                 is DERIVED, for the given training set, as
                     n_batches = ceil( N_train / (C * B_c) ),
                 with N_train = len(train_ds.index) the number of training
                 windows: one nominal pass over the training windows per epoch.
    P_b, N_b   : for source window b of a batch, the number of profile-PRESERVING
                 surrogates (positives, including the clean anchor) and
                 profile-DESTROYING surrogates (negatives) produced by the
                 augmentation module for that window.
    M          : rows in one embedding batch, M = sum_b (1 + P_b + N_b), summed
                 over the C * B_c source windows b of the batch.
    X          : (M, n_channels, T) float32, the batch of windows fed to the
                 network; T is the window length in samples and n_channels =
                 cfg.data.n_channels = cfg.backbone.in_channels is the trace
                 channel count (per-region IFRs). NOTE: n_channels is NOT the
                 phenotype-class count C used above -- they are independent axes.
                 For n_channels == 1 the collator emits (M, T) and the backbone
                 stem unsqueezes it to (M, 1, T); for n_channels > 1 it emits
                 (M, n_channels, T) directly. The training X -> model(X) path is
                 shape-correct in both cases with no reshape, because the channel
                 axis rides through the collator's torch.cat and the backbone
                 forward accepts (M, n_channels, T).
    y          : (M,) int64 labels under the locked option-(b) scheme:
                 y_r = c_b in {0, ..., C-1} for every positive row r coming from a
                 source window b of phenotype c_b, and y_r = a UNIQUE integer
                 (>= TripletCollator.unique_label_base) for every destroyed
                 surrogate row r. A unique label can never be matched by a second
                 row, so a destroyed surrogate is, by construction, only ever
                 usable as a NEGATIVE -- it is a per-anchor hard negative and
                 never a positive for anything.

Model / objective
    theta      : the network parameters
    f_theta    : the backbone, f_theta(X) = Z
    Z          : (M, E) float32 embeddings, E = cfg.backbone.embedding_size. Rows
                 are L2-normalized by the backbone head (cfg.backbone
                 .l2_normalize, default True), so every z_r lies on the unit
                 hypersphere S^{E-1}.
    d_cos(u,v) : cosine distance, d_cos(u, v) = 1 - (u . v) / (||u||_2 ||v||_2).
    m          : cfg.train.margin, the loss margin. On L2-normalized embeddings
                 with the cosine distance, m is a COSINE-SIMILARITY GAP, not a raw
                 angular margin: the two are related nonlinearly through
                 cos(angle). (Decision 7. Flagged explicitly so the searched range
                 in Stage 7 is not misread as an angle in radians.)
    T_mined    : the set of triplets (a, p, n) returned by the miner for a batch,
                 where a, p, n are ROW indices into Z with y_a = y_p and
                 y_a != y_n. |T_mined| may be 0 for a batch (no triplet violates
                 the margin); such a batch contributes 0 to the loss.
    L_batch    : the reduced triplet loss over T_mined, as computed by
                 pytorch_metric_learning's TripletMarginLoss with
                 reducers.AvgNonZeroReducer (the mean over the NON-ZERO triplet
                 losses only, so already-satisfied triplets do not dilute the
                 signal toward 0).
    L_epoch    : the epoch training loss reported in history, the mean of L_batch
                 over the n_batches batches of the epoch,
                     L_epoch = (1 / n_batches) * sum_{batches} L_batch.
                 It is the BACKPROP TARGET ONLY and is NEVER a selection metric
                 (decision 3).

Sign convention (verified against the library, not assumed)
-----------------------------------------------------------
    distances.CosineSimilarity is an INVERTED metric (is_inverted = True: larger
    means CLOSER). Both the loss and the miner read that flag and internally form
    the triplet margin as (d_ap - d_an) for inverted metrics instead of
    (d_an - d_ap). Therefore the margin m keeps its usual "how much closer the
    positive must be than the negative" meaning and NO manual sign flip is done
    here. CRITICAL: the miner's DEFAULT distance is LpDistance (Euclidean), so the
    SAME CosineSimilarity object family must be passed EXPLICITLY to the miner as
    well as to the loss; otherwise the miner would select triplets under Euclidean
    geometry while the loss scored them under cosine -- a silent
    miner/objective mismatch.

Model selection (decision 3 + the locked early-stopping rule, decision 17)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
After each epoch e (e = 1, ..., E_max) the model is evaluated on the VALIDATION
split by embedding its CLEAN, DISTINCT windows (inference.embed_clean_windows)
and scoring them with metrics.clustering_metrics:

    ARI_e : adjusted Rand index at epoch e, of a single seeded K-means (K = C) on
            the full-dimensional validation embeddings, against the true labels.
    Sil_e : mean silhouette at epoch e, against the TRUE labels, with cosine
            distance.

Let ARI*_{e-1} and Sil*_{e-1} be the running best-so-far over epochs 1..e-1
(with ARI*_0 = Sil*_0 = -infinity), delta = cfg.train.min_delta_ari, and
epsilon = cfg.train.min_delta_sil. Write (u_e, v_e) for the (primary, secondary)
signals: (u_e, v_e) = (ARI_e, Sil_e) when cfg.train.selection_primary == "ari"
(the default), and (u_e, v_e) = (Sil_e, ARI_e) when it is "silhouette"; delta and
epsilon follow their signal. Then epoch e counts as an IMPROVEMENT iff

    u_e > u*_{e-1} + delta                                     (primary improves)
      OR ( u_e <= u*_{e-1} + delta   AND   v_e > v*_{e-1} + epsilon )
                                        (primary flat AND secondary improves)

The patience counter increments ONLY when BOTH clauses fail (i.e. both signals
have flattened), and RESETS to 0 on any improvement. Training stops at

    E_stop = min(e_patience, E_max),

where e_patience is the first epoch at which the counter reaches
P = cfg.train.patience. The BEST epoch is the lexicographic argmax over e of the
pair (u_e, v_e) -- primary first, secondary as the tie-break -- and the
BEST-EPOCH weights are RESTORED into the returned model (NOT the last epoch's).
A NaN metric (possible on a degenerate embedding) is treated as -infinity for
both comparison and argmax, so it can never win selection or reset patience.

Anti-collapse (decision 5): metrics.embedding_health is computed on the same
validation embedding and logged into history. It is MONITOR-ONLY and is NEVER
added to the loss.

    The SAME distance family (CosineSimilarity, an inverted metric) is passed
    EXPLICITLY to both. Passing it only to the loss would leave the miner on its
    LpDistance default, so the mined triplets and the scored triplets would live
    in different geometries.

    THE MINER IS UNAFFECTED BY loss_type: all three mining strategies stay
    available under every loss. The composite loss hands whatever the miner
    returned to pytorch_metric_learning's own lmu.convert_to_triplets, so a
    3-tuple from a triplet miner and a 4-tuple from a pair miner are converted
    by exactly the rule TripletMarginLoss already applies internally.

    loss_type dispatch:
      "triplet"   -- losses.TripletMarginLoss, unchanged, the default
      "joint"     -- JointTripletLoss (margin + angular hinge, optional filter)
      "joint_sep" -- CompositeDSNLoss (the above + the gated separation term)

    The margin is stated in COSINE distance in the config and the composite loss
    works in SQUARED EUCLIDEAN, so it is converted here, once, explicitly:
    ||u - v||^2 = 2 d_cos(u, v), hence margin = 2 * m_cos. The MINER keeps the
    cosine margin, because it scores under CosineSimilarity.

    n_classes (C) is required for "joint_sep": the separation target -1/(K-1)
    and the supervised class masking are both built from it.

    total_steps (T = max_epochs * batches_per_epoch) is required for
    "joint_sep" whenever train_cfg.sep_warmup_frac > 0: it is the horizon the
    separation weight ramps over. Passing None with a nonzero tau is not an
    error but it is not a warm-up either -- SepWarmup warns and holds the
    weight constant, because a ramp without a horizon is not well posed.

    THE SILHOUETTE GATE IS NO LONGER BUILT. sep_gate_threshold,
    sep_gate_momentum and sep_gate_min_batches remain in TrainConfig so every

    MEAWindowDataset owns a PERSISTENT numpy Generator (self.rng), created once in

    surrogate draw for a window therefore depends on how many items were drawn
    before it IN THE LIFETIME OF THAT DATASET OBJECT, not on the seed alone.

    That matters here because the Stage-7 objective calls train() n_seeds times on
    the SAME dataset instances: without this re-seed, run k inherits whatever RNG
    state run k-1 left behind, so two runs with identical seeds see DIFFERENT
    augmentations, HPO trials stop being reproducible, and the seed-to-seed std the
    search reports gets contaminated by dataset call-history effects.

    num_workers == 0 -- which is the CPU / HPC-safe default -- so the epoch loop
    re-seeds explicitly. We derive the stream from (seed, epoch) so that:

      * a RESUMED run's epoch e sees the same stream as the uninterrupted run's
        epoch e (the state is a pure function of (seed, epoch), not of history).

preprocessing_cache.py
======================

Persist the expensive per-well trace computation ONCE, so the HPO loop (many
trials) and the final run all read the same pre-computed traces from disk
instead of recomputing them every time. Separation of concerns (directive 2):
this module does persistence only. It does not know how a trace is produced --
that is the job of an injectable "provider" callable (directive 1: reuse the
tested providers in data_pipeline.py: SyntheticTraceProvider / MultiClassSynthetic
Provider, NeuronalTracesProvider, NumpyTraceProvider).

A provider is any callable with signature

    provider(*args) -> (trace: np.ndarray of shape (K,), fs: float)

On-disk format (per trace)
--------------------------
    <cache_dir>/<name>.npz  with arrays / scalars:
        ifr_trace : (K,) float32   -- the trace samples
        fs_ifr    : float          -- sampling rate [Hz]
        condition : int            -- phenotype label (0..C-1)
        name      : str            -- unique id (well id / trace id)
        culture   : str            -- CULTURE id  [K3]

The keys ifr_trace / fs_ifr match what NumpyTraceProvider already expects, so a
cached file is ALSO loadable by that provider.

    <cache_dir>/manifest.json : ordered list of entries
        [{"name","condition","fs","length","file","culture"}, ...]

[K3] Culture grouping. `name` is a per-TRACE primary key; `culture` is the id of
the biological unit the trace came from. They differ only when several trace
records share one recording -- the case the channel-subset extractor produces in
mode='per_region_single', where one well yields C single-channel subregion
traces. Grouping them is what keeps sibling subregions (i) inside one split and
(ii) out of each other's positive pairs. When `culture` is not supplied it
defaults to `name`, i.e. one trace == one culture, which is the behaviour of
every configuration written before this field existed.

The manifest, not the .npz files, is the source of truth for the culture
assignment: an .npz cached before this field existed carries no `culture` key,
but the manifest is rewritten on every run, so a legacy cache directory still
yields a correct (identity) grouping through load_cached_cultures().

HPC note (hpc-python-compat): pure ASCII. The manifest is written atomically
(temp file + os.replace) so an interrupted run cannot leave a half-written index.
